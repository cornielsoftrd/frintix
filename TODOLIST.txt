ðŸ”¥ Perfect â€” now you have BusinessClient registration with users working. Thatâ€™s a huge milestone!
Letâ€™s think about the next steps in your app roadmap so you can start connecting the pieces:

âœ… What You Have So Far

Multi-tenancy with django-tenants:

Each Restaurant (Company) is a tenant.

Users & Roles in shared_core:

restaurant_admin, employee, retail_customer.

BusinessClient API:

Can create BusinessClient + associated User.

Orders API:

Works for retail_customer and employee.

ðŸš€ Next Steps
1. Employee Management (per BusinessClient)

BusinessClients need to add their employees.

Each Employee is a User with role "employee" and a relation to their BusinessClient.

Add endpoints:

POST /api/business-clients/{id}/employees/ â†’ create employee

GET /api/business-clients/{id}/employees/ â†’ list employees

Make sure only BusinessClient admin can manage them.

2. BusinessClient Ordering Flow

Right now:

Orders require retail_customer or employee.

Next:

âœ… Ensure employee orders are linked to their BusinessClient.

When an employee places an order:

Save order.business_client = employee.business_client

This allows payroll or monthly billing later.

3. Restaurant Catalog

restaurant_admin should be able to create:

Products

Menus

Combos

Permissions must enforce:

Only restaurant_admin inside their tenant can manage catalog.

Employees/retail customers can only view.

4. Order Management

Extend the order flow:

Employees place orders â†’ linked to their BusinessClient.

Retail customers place orders â†’ linked only to themselves.

Restaurant admins should see all orders for their tenant.

BusinessClient admins should see all employee orders linked to them.

5. Billing & Payroll

Start designing billing logic:

Retail orders â†’ paid at checkout.

Employee orders â†’ billed to their BusinessClient.

Later you can add:

Monthly invoices for BusinessClients.

Payroll deductions (if you integrate with HR/payroll systems).

6. Polish Authentication

Right now BusinessClient, Employee, and RetailCustomer register separately.

Later, unify the flow:

POST /api/auth/register with type = "restaurant_admin" | "business_client" | "retail_customer" | "employee"

Assigns proper role and creates relationships.

ðŸ‘‰ So the immediate next step after creating BusinessClient should be:
Build Employee management endpoints and make sure employee orders automatically link to their BusinessClient.

Do you want me to sketch out the Employee API (models, serializers, views, permissions) so you can plug it in right after BusinessClient?
